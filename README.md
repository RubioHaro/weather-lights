## Project Setup

This project consists of two main components: the API and the Frontend. The API is built using NestJS, while the Frontend is developed with React and TypeScript.

Run Project: Read the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file for detailed instructions on how to set up and run both the API and Frontend.


## Documentation (Swagger)

The API documentation is available through Swagger. To access it, follow these steps:

1. Start the API server by running `npm run start:api`.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

This will take you to the Swagger UI, where you can explore the available API endpoints, view request and response schemas, and even test the API directly from the documentation interface.
